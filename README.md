**Email SMS Classifier -**

The Email SMS Classifier project focuses on building a machine learning model that can differentiate between email and SMS messages.
This involves data preprocessing, feature extraction (such as using TF-IDF or word embeddings),
and training a classifier (like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or an advanced algorithm) to categorize text messages as either email or SMS.
The project demonstrates expertise in natural language processing (NLP), text classification, and model evaluation.
